# Sass boilerplate

This is a starting point for projects using Sass. The following features are included:

* Folder structure orientated on the [7-1 Pattern](http://sass-guidelin.es/#the-7-1-pattern)
* Reset (provided by [normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/))
* Base styling and best practices
* Print styles (taken from [HTML5 boilerplate](https://html5boilerplate.com/))
* Useful mixins (bemify, mediaquery, prefix, font-size)
* Helper functions, classes and placeholders
* Base variable template

Everything is included in the `main.scss` file. To get started compile everything using this as entry point.
